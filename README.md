# TimeSeriesForecasting-AN2DL

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in order to forecast seven different signals over a time horizon of 864 time samples.

A complete report of the architecture of the network and the achieved results can be found [here]().

## Technologies 
This project has been created with Keras and Tensorflow using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
